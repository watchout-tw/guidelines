# CSS

## Comments

Well commented code is extremely important. Take time to describe components,
how they work, their limitations, and the way they are constructed. Don't leave
others in the team guessing as to the purpose of uncommon or non-obvious
code.

Comment style should be simple and consistent within a single code base.

* Place comments on a new line above their subject.
* Keep line-length to a sensible maximum, e.g., 80 columns.
* Make liberal use of comments to break CSS code into discrete sections.
* Use "sentence case" comments and consistent text indentation.
* Use numeric end-of-line comments to reference documentation for individual declarations.

Tip: configure your editor to provide you with shortcuts to output agreed-upon
comment patterns.

Example:

```css
/**
 * Short description using Doxygen-style comment format
 *
 * The first sentence of the long description starts here and continues on this
 * line for a while finally concluding here at the end of this paragraph.
 *
 * The long description is ideal for more detailed explanations and
 * documentation. It can include example HTML, URLs, or any other information
 * that is deemed necessary or useful.
 *
 * TODO: This is a todo statement that describes an atomic task to be completed
 *   at a later date. It wraps after 80 characters and following lines are
 *   indented by 2 spaces.
 *
 * @tag This is a tag named 'tag'
 *
 * 1. A helpful description of a declaration's purpose.
 * 2. Another declaration or collection of declarations can reference this
 *    comment with an inline comment corresponding to the lists number.

/* Thematic section comment block

/* Basic comment */
```

## Format

The chosen code format ensures that code is: easy to read; easy to clearly
comment; minimizes the chance of accidentally introducing errors; and results
in useful diffs and blames.

* Use one discrete selector per line in multi-selector rulesets.
* Include a single space before the opening brace of a ruleset.
* Include one declaration per line in a declaration block.
* Use one level of indentation for each declaration.
* Include a single space after the colon of a declaration.
* Use lowercase and shorthand hex values, e.g., `#aaa`.
* Use single or double quotes consistently. Preference is for double quotes,
  e.g., `content: ""`.
* Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., `input[type="checkbox"]`.
* _Where allowed_, avoid specifying units for zero-values, e.g., `margin: 0`.
* Include a space after each comma in comma-separated property or function
  values.
* Include a semi-colon at the end of the last declaration in a declaration
  block.
* Place the closing brace of a ruleset in the same column as the first
  character of the ruleset.
* Separate each ruleset by a blank line.

```css
.selector-1,
.selector-2,
.selector-3[type="text"] {
  background: #fff;
  background: linear-gradient(#fff, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8));
  box-sizing: border-box;
  color: #333;
  display: block;
  font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
}

.selector-a,
.selector-b {
  padding: 10px;
}
```

### Declaration order

Use alphabetical ordering of declarations unless the cascade absolutely
requires otherwise.

```css
.selector {
  background: #000;
  border: 10px solid #333;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  color: #fff;
  display: inline-block;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  text-align: right;
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Exceptions and slight deviations

Large blocks of single declarations can use a slightly different, single-line
format. In this case, a space should be included after the opening brace and
before the closing brace.

```css
.selector-1 { width: 10%; }
.selector-2 { width: 20%; }
.selector-3 { width: 30%; }
```

Long, comma-separated property values - such as collections of gradients or
shadows - can be arranged across multiple lines in an effort to improve
readability and produce more useful diffs.

```css
.selector {
  background-image:
    linear-gradient(#fff, #ccc),
    linear-gradient(#f3c, #4ec);
  box-shadow:
    1px 1px 1px #000,
    2px 2px 1px 1px #ccc inset;
}
```

## Practical example

An example of various conventions.

```css
/** @define Grid; use strict */

/**
 * Column layout with horizontal scroll.
 *
 * This creates a single row of full-height, non-wrapping columns that can
 * be browsed horizontally within their parent.
 *
 * Example HTML:
 *
 * <div class="Grid">
 *   <div class="Grid-cell Grid-cell--3"></div>
 *   <div class="Grid-cell Grid-cell--3"></div>
 *   <div class="Grid-cell Grid-cell--3"></div>
 * </div>
 */

/**
 * Grid container
 *
 * Must only contain `.Grid-cell` children.
 *
 * 1. Remove inter-cell whitespace
 * 2. Prevent inline-block cells wrapping
 */

.Grid {
  font-size: 0; /* 1 */
  height: 100%;
  white-space: nowrap; /* 2 */
}

/**
 * Grid cells
 *
 * No explicit width by default. Extend with `.Grid-cell--n` classes.
 *
 * 1. Reset font-size inherited from `.Grid`
 * 2. Set the inter-cell spacing
 * 3. Reset white-space inherited from `.Grid`
 */

.Grid-cell {
  border: 2px solid #333;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 1rem; /* 1 */
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0 10px; /* 2 */
  position: relative;
  vertical-align: top;
  white-space: normal; /* 3 */
}

/* Cell states */

.Grid-cell.is-animating {
  background-color: #fffdec;
}

/* Cell dimension modifiers
   ========================================================================== */

.Grid-cell--1 { width: 10%; }
.Grid-cell--2 { width: 20%; }
.Grid-cell--3 { width: 30%; }
.Grid-cell--4 { width: 40%; }
.Grid-cell--5 { width: 50%; }

/* Cell modifiers
   ========================================================================== */

.Grid-cell--detail,
.Grid-cell--important {
  border-width: 4px;
}
```
